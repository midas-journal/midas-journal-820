This project is part of the 3D Toolkit (3DTK).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the project simply call "make". This will configure 3DTK-planes using the
default settings. If you wish to configure the project using custom settings do:
you may change into the build directory ".build" and configure the
project with your preferred cmake configurator, i.e.:
cd .build && cmake -i ../

For Microsoft Windows, use the cmake-gui application provided by cmake to
configure and generate project files for the appropriate version of visual
studio of your system. Use the INSTALL target to built the entire project.
Executables (and .dll's) will then reside in the "windows" folder.

For a detailed explanation of how to use the VTK Wrapper for the implementation
of the Hough Transform n 3DTK see:
Dorit Borrmann and David Doria. Hough Transform Plane Detector. The VTK Journal,
June 2011.

For a detailed explanation of the functionality of the programm, please
refer to:
Dorit Borrmann, Jan Elseberg, Kai Lingemann, and Andreas NÃ¼chter. The 3D
Hough Transform for Plane Detection in Point Clouds - A Review and A new
Accumulator Design, Journal 3D Research, Springer, Volume 2, Number 2, 
March 2011.

Two example point clouds are included in the data directory.

EXAMPLES:
(using the data set in the repository, the result will be a the point cloud
data/counter_out.vtp, with each point label with the color of the plane)
bin/HoughPlanes data/counter.vtp data/counter_out.vtp

The parameters for the Hough Transform can either be specified directly using
SetFunctions or given in a config file. See bin/hough.cfg for an example.
